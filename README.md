## Notes

- As a beginner, I faced a steep learning curve when it comes to understanding the basics of web development. This includes learning HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring web pages, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and potentially JavaScript for adding interactivity. Acquiring these skills and understanding how they work together can be challenging at first.
